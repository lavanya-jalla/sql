# SQL

A structured collection of SQL scripts for learning, practicing, and demonstrating SQL concepts using MySQL / MariaDB.
This repository includes database creation scripts, sample data, and a variety of SQL queries from basic to advanced levels.


SQL (Structured Query Language) is a powerful and standard language used to store, manage, and retrieve data in relational databases. It allows users to easily create and modify database structures, insert and update records, and extract information using simple, English-like commands. 

SQL supports complex tasks such as filtering, sorting, grouping, joining tables, and performing calculations on large datasets. With built-in security features, transaction control, and ACID properties, SQL ensures data accuracy, reliability, and safety. 

It is widely used in various applications such as banking, e-commerce, education, healthcare, analytics, and mobile/web development, making it an essential skill for handling structured data efficiently.
